# Note Taker
Using the power of Express, Heroku, and Javascript create a server compatible note taking application

# Description

This project is the whole shebang.  We have a database(..kinda), a frontend, a backend, and a a deployed link. Basically everything that a real website needs.  Having the front end built up is nice and really showed off how the front end calls the backend.  The backend was pretty simple cause it was mainly getting the right endpoints calls, handling the data and returning it.  What was really nice was how the front end handled the data.  I thought that you would do a simple fetch request and refresh of the page, but looking at the code, the front end takes the promised note object, creates a new html element and inserts into the page without refreshing.  That was really cool.

I create this project to test out express.js and because I am really bad at remember things

I hope you guys enjoy it.
